The Oracle Big Data Service (BDS) is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) service designed for a diverse set of big data use cases and workloads. From short-lived clusters used to tackle specific tasks to long-lived clusters that manage data lakes. BDS scales to meet an organization's requirements at a low cost and with the highest levels of security. To be able to connect to the BDS from the notebook session, the cluster created must have Kerberos enabled.

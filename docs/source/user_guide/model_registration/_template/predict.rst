To invoke the endpoint of your deployed model, call the ``.predict()`` method. The ``.predict()`` method sends a request to the deployed endpoint, and computes the inference values based on the data that you input in the ``.predict()`` method.

See how to deploy and invoke deployed endpoint for different frameworks :doc:`here<framework_specific_instruction>`.

See `API documentation <../../ads.model.html#id11>`__ for more details about the parameters.

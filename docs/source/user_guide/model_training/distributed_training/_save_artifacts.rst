**Saving Artifacts to Object Storage Buckets**


In case you want to save the artifacts generated by the training process (model checkpoints, TensorBoard logs, etc.) to an object bucket
you can use the 'sync' feature. The environment variable ``OCI__SYNC_DIR`` exposes the directory location that will be automatically synchronized
to the configured object storage bucket location. Use this directory in your training script to save the artifacts.

To configure the destination object storage bucket location, use the following settings in the workload yaml file(train.yaml).

.. code-block:: bash

    - name: SYNC_ARTIFACTS
      value: 1
    - name: WORKSPACE
      value: "<bucket_name>"
    - name: WORKSPACE_PREFIX
      value: "<bucket_prefix>"

**Note**: Change ``SYNC_ARTIFACTS`` to ``0`` to disable this feature.
Use ``OCI__SYNC_DIR`` env variable in your code to save the artifacts. For Example :

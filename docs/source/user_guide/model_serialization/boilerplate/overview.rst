The ``.verify()`` method simulates a model deployment by calling the ``load_model()`` and ``predict()`` methods in the ``score.py`` file.  With the ``.verify()`` method, you can debug your ``score.py`` file without deploying any models. The ``.save()`` method deploys a model artifact to the model catalog. The ``.deploy()`` method deploys a model to a REST endpoint.

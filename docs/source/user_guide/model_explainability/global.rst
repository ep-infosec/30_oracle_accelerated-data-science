Global Explainers
=================

Global explanations help to understand the model's general behavior.

There are multiple forms of global explanations. For example, global explanations:

- Can identify the important features that the model considers when making its predictions.
- Highlight the relationship between different feature values and the model's predictions.
- Present the instances that are most influential towards the prediction of a given class and value.
